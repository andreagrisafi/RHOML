Symmetry-Adapted Learning of Three-dimensional Electron Densities
=================================================================
This repository contains an implementation of sparse Gaussian Process Regression that is suitable to do machine learning of any three-dimensional scalar field, e.g., the electron density of a system, that is expanded on an atom-centered basis made of radial functions and spherical harmonics.

Requirements and Installation
-----------------------------
This code is written in a mixture of Python2 and Fortran90 with OpenMP parallelization.

To install it, :code:`make` in the main folder and :code:`source env.sh`  


Dependencies
------------

The legacy version of SALTED uses a legacy version of TENSOAP  called SOAPFAST. It is included in this branch, since it is no longer available through the TENSOAP repository. Note that it requires Python3, while the rest of SALTED uses Python2.

Input Dataset
-------------
Geometries of the input structures are required in :code:`xyz` format.

The training target consists in the projection of the scalar-field over atom-centered basis functions made of radial functions and spherical harmonics. We assume to work with real spherical harmonics defined with the Condon-Shortley phase convention. No restriction is instead imposed on the nature of the radial functions. Given the basis is non-orthogonal, the overlap matrix between the basis functions is also required as an input. Note that the well-conditioning of this matrix is a crucial aspect for the method performance.

For each dataset configuration, both the scalar-field projection vector and the overlap matrix are needed. The dimensionality of these arrays has to correspond to the number of atoms, as sorted in the geometry file, times the non-redundant number of basis functions belonging to each atom. The ordering of the basis set follows a hierarchical structure: 

1) For a given atomic species X, loop over the angular orders {L} 

2) For a given combination (X,L), loop over the radial functions {n} 

3) Loop over the angular functions sorted as -L,...,0,...,+L

The possible basis set choices appear in :code:`src/basis.py`. If you want to use a basis that is not included in this file, it is easy enough to add a new one together with the proper dimensions.


a) SALTED water molecules
--------------------------
In this example, we consider the interpolation of the electron density of a dataset made of 1000 isolated water molecules. For that, go into the example folder :code:`examples/water_monomer`. The file :code:`inp.py` contains the input parameters of the calculation, while the file :code:`water_monomers_1k.xyz` contains the atomic coordinates of the system. Both the file-name of the input geometry and an ordered list of the atomic species included in the dataset need to be specified in :code:`inp.py`. The path to the folder used to save the heavy input data (overlaps and projections) must be set using the :code:`path2indata` variable; the path to the folder used to save the heavy data produced by SALTED (SOAP descriptors, kernels, etc.) must be set using the :code:`path2data` variable. In the following, we consider the possibility of generating the input densities from scratch. If you want to use your own density matrices, then jump to point 2. If you want to use your own RI-density projections and overlaps, then jump to point 3. 

1) We start generating the density matrices associated with a KS-DFT calculation using PySCF. The QM variables needed as input are the DFT functional (:code:`functional = "b3lyp"`) and the wave-function basis set (:code:`qmbasis = "cc-pvqz"`). To run the QM calculations for each structure in the dataset:: 

        for i in {1..1000}; do python $SALTEDPATH/run_pyscf.py -iconf ${i}; done 

   The density matrices, saved as :code:`dm_conf#.npy`, can be found in the folder :code:`path2indata/density_matrices/`.

2) From the density matrices, the resolution of the identity (RI) method can be used to compute the density components on a linear auxiliary basis. The density matrix is assumed to be saved according to the PySCF convention, that is, as -L,...,0,...,+L for L>1 and as +1,-1,0 for L=1. The RI-auxiliary basis must correspond to its wave-function counterpart and can be set as :code:`dfbasis = "RI-cc-pvqz"`. To compute the RI projections and overlaps for each structure of the dataset, run::

       for i in {1..1000}; do python $SALTEDPATH/dm2df.py -iconf ${i}; done

   The projections and overlaps, saved as :code:`projections_conf#.npy` and :code:`overlap_conf#.npy`, can be found in the folders :code:`path2indata/projections/` and :code:`path2indata/overlaps`, respectively.   

3) We now need to compute the mean spherical density projections over the dataset in order to use them as a baseline value for the RI-density projections. To do so, run::

       python $SALTEDPATH/initialize.py

4) Using the SOAPFAST package, we then need to generate the L-SOAP structural features up to the maximum angular momentum :code:`-lm` included in the expansion of the density field (up to L=5 in this case). To do so, run:: 

        cd path2data
        mkdir soaps
        cd -

        for i in 0 1 2 3 4 5
        do      
           python SOAPFAST/soapfast/get_power_spectrum.py -f coords_water_monomers_1k.xyz -lm ${i} -cs -c H O -s H O -l 4 -n 5 -o path2data/soaps/SOAP-${i}
        done 

   Note that the species of the atoms used as expansion centers, defined by the list :code:`-c H O`, must be sorted exactly as specified in :code:`inp.py`. The centers sorting option is activated by the flag :code:`-cs`.

5) Extract a sparse set of atomic environments to reduce the dimensionality of the regression problem. The number of these environments is specified by the input variable :code:`Menv = 100`. This is done via the farthest point sampling (FPS) method, using the 0-SOAP features previously computed as a metric to distiguish between any pair of atomic environments::

        python $SALTEDPATH/sparse_set.py 


5) Compute the block diagonal kernel matrix for the selected sparse set of atomic environments::  

        python $SALTEDPATH/kernel_mm.py 

6) For each configuration of the dataset, compute the kernel matrix that couples the atoms of that configuration with the selected sparse set of atomic environments:: 

        python $SALTEDPATH/kernel_nm.py

   The kernel matrices can be found in the folder :code:`path2data/kernels/`. 

7) Partition the dataset into training and validation set by selecting :code:`Ntrain = 200` training configurations at random. Then, compute the regression vector A and the regression matrix B using a given training set fraction :code:`trainfrac = 1.0`::

        python $SALTEDPATH/matrices.py 

8) Perform the regression with a given regularization :code:`regul = 1e-08` and jitter value :code:`jitter = 1e-10`, needed to stabilize the matrix inversion::

        python $SALTEDPATH/learn.py 

9) Predict the expansion coefficients of the scalar field over the validation set::

        python $SALTEDPATH/validate.py 
   
   which will be saved as :code:`pred_coeffs.npy`.

10) Print out the predicted scalar field projections in the folder :code:`path2data/predictions/` and compute the root mean square error both on the individual scalar fields (:code:`errors.dat`) and on the overall test dataset (printed out to screen):: 

        python $SALTEDPATH/error_validation.py


    This gives a RMSE of about 0.6% of the intrinsic variability of the electron density over the test set.

11) On top of the predicted density components, compute the Hartree energy and the external energy of the system compared against the RI reference values::

        python $SALTEDPATH/electrostatics.py


    This gives a RMSE of about 0.9 kcal/mol on the final electrostatic energy, corresponding to about 0.17% of the standard deviation over the validation set.


b) ED of water dimers from SALTED water molecules
----------------------------------------------
In this example, we will predict the electron density of 10 water dimers at a large reciprocal distance based on the SALTED exercise carried out for the dataset of isolated water molecules. The input file specifies the file-name of the reference (:code:`water_monomers_1k.xyz`) and new geometry (:code:`water_dimers_10.xyz`), together with the path to the folder where the SALTED exercise has been carried out (:code:`path2ref = ../water_monomer`). Please also specify the path that you used to save the heavy reference data (:code:`path2data_ref`) and the path that you will use to save the new heavy data (:code:`path2data`). If the error associated with the predictions is calculated, the overlaps and projections should be stored at `path2indata`.

Before starting, you need to: i) generate the reference RI-overlaps and RI-density projections of the 10 water dimers as described in points 1)-2) of the previous example, using the very same basis already adopted for the water molecules, ii) compute the L-SOAP features as described in point 4) of the previous example, using the very same parameters adopted for the isolated molecules. The new steps to be undertaken are then described as follows:

1) Compute the cross kernel between the monomers and dimers features::

        python $SALTEDPATH/kernel_tm.py

   The kernel matrices can be found in the folder :code:`path2data/kernels/`.

2) Predict the water dimers densities combining the kernels so computed with the regression weights obtained during the previous example (:code:`path2ref/weights.npy`)::

        python $SALTEDPATH/predict.py

3) Compute the error associated with the predictions::

        python $SALTEDPATH/error_prediction.py

   This gives a RMSE of about 0.3%, according to the isolated molecule case.


Additional Options
------------------

-- PARALLEL TRAINING: At runtime, :code:`matrices.py` may be called with the options :code:`-p` and :code:`-b` (:code:`--partial` and :code:`--partial_block`). These options divide the training configurations into blocks of size :code:`b`, and calculates the regression vector A and matrix B for just the :code:`pth` block of structures, outputting :code:`A_p_vector.npy` and :code:`B_p_vector.npy`. This allows the calculation of the matrices to be parallelised across many nodes, since the full vector and matrix can be obtained simply by summing these partial matrices.

-- CROSS-VALIDATION: Setting :code:`xv = True` in :code:`inp.py` will perform a two-fold cross-validation on the training set when following example a). The dataset will automatically be partitioned into a training and validation set of equal size, overriding the `:code:Ntrain` and :code:`frac` options. Two sets of regression vectors A, matrices B, weights and predicted coefficients will be produced, one labelled with the training set fraction implicitly defined. :code:`error_validation.py` will print the RMSE for each half of the cross-validation, along with the average of the two errors.

-- SVD SOLUTION: Setting :code:`svd = True` will result in the singular value decomposition method of :code:`numpy.linalg.lstsq` being used to solve the regression problem in :code:`learn.py`. This is slower, but generally leads to a more stable solution, particular when the resulting weights are applied to a test set. In this case the :code:`jitter` parameter is ignored.

-- EFFICIENT LEARNING CURVES: If the regression matrices are calculated in blocks, :code:`learn.py` may also be called with the runtime option :code:`-np` (--number_partial). This will contruct the regression vector and matrix from the first :code:`np` partial matrices. This enables the efficient construction of a learning curve, avoiding unnecessary recalculations of the regression matrices.

NB: The runtime options :code:`-p` (or :code:`-np`) are incompatible with the option :code:`xv`.
